<h1>SpendSpentSpent Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The SpendSpentSpent mobile application does not collect any personal data from users. User accounts are linked to the
    server they choose to use, whether it is a self‑hosted or third‑party server. The developers of SpendSpentSpent do
    not operate public servers except for an optional demo server.</p>

<p>When using a SpendSpentSpent server, the following information may be collected:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email address:</strong>required solely for authentication, password recovery, and to send recurring
        expense reports.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Location data:</strong>captured only when the user explicitly permits the application to use location
        services during expense creation. This information is not used to build a user profile.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The SpendSpentSpent developers neither own nor share the data listed above. All collected data is transmitted
    exclusively to the host of the server and is never processed for analytics purposes.</strong></p>

<p>Enabling the notification listener does not result in any data being sent to the server; all processing occurs
    locally on the device.</p>
